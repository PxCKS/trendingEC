#Python Database Frameworks

> Python offers database abstraction layers packages such as MongoEngine and SQLAlchemy
> These packages allows developers to work at a higher level with regular Python objects instead offers of
  database entities such as tables, documents, or query language.

> Abstraction layers are also called object-relational mappers (ORM) or object-document mappers (ODMs)
>These provide transparent conversion of high-level object-oriented operations into low-level database instructions.
